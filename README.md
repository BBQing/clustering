# clustering

Senior Python Developer Assignment Overview
Task Overview
Develop a command-line tool for data clustering. This task is your opportunity to
demonstrate your proficiency in writing clean, well-organized code. You are expected to
adhere to best coding practices, utilize dependency injection, and ensure consistent coding
style with the aid of pre-commit hooks.
Objectives
● Code Quality: Your code should be clear and well-organized, exemplifying the
essence of durable software.
● Best Practices: Follow industry-standard best practices, including SOLID principles,
to ensure the software remains scalable and of high quality.
● Dependency Injection: Leverage the Dependency Injector library for efficient
management of software components.
● Style Consistency: Set up pre-commit hooks to automate checks for code quality,
including syntax verification, linting, and formatting.
Goal
Demonstrate your technical skills, dedication to quality, and comprehensive approach to
software development from the initial concept to the final implementation.
Specifications
● Input Data: The tool should accept data in either JSON format or as NumPy arrays.
● Output Data: Ensure the tool supports output in both JSON format and NumPy
arrays.
● Clustering:
○ Framework: Utilize scikit-learn for all clustering-related functionalities.
○ Algorithm Selection: Select and implement three distinct clustering
algorithms from scikit-learn to illustrate varied strategies.
○ Hyperparameters: Provide options for customizable hyperparameter
settings.

● Configuration: Manage all settings, including choices of algorithms,
hyperparameters, and data formats, through a config.yaml file. Use
providers.Selector for flexible algorithm selection, enhancing the tool’s
adaptability.
Code and Repository Requirements
● Readability and Structure: Ensure your code is readable and elegantly structured.
● Documentation: Thoroughly document methods and functions using google style
docstrings.
● Testing: Perform unit tests, and, where applicable, end-to-end or integration tests
utilizing pytest and mocker.

● Pre-commit Setup: Configure pre-commit hooks for automated checks to maintain
code quality.
Git Practices
Maintain an organized commit history by making small, self-contained commits that either
introduce a single change or add a new feature.
Submission
● Repository: Submit your completed code on GitHub, including a comprehensive
README that outlines the setup, configuration, and usage guidelines. Intercorporate
the described pre-commit hooks.
● Delivery: Share the repository link via email or through the application tracking
system.
This assignment assesses your skills in software design, library integration, testing
strategies, version control, and code quality management. We look forward to your
submission!
